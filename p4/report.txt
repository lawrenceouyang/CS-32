Unfortunately, I did not manage to complete my search function. The Search criteria
is fully operational, however the sort is not. Parts of my sort code are incomplete,
but are still in the source code.

To my knowledge, all MultiMap and Database functions comply with the time complexity
requirements for the project.

MultiMap::findEqual(string key)

set iterator to root node
repeatedly while iterator is in valid state:
	if iterator's key is equal to key, return iterator
	otherwise, if iterator's key is greather than key, move iterator to next element
	otherwise, if iterator's key is less than key, move iterator to previous element

otherwise, return the iterator, which at this point should be in an invalid state


MultiMap::Iterator::next()

if iterator is not valid return false

if the node's right node is not invalid
while the node's right child is not invalid
move the iterator to point to the rightmost node
if at any point the node and its parent are equal, return true

while the node's left child is not invalid
move the iterator to point to the leftmost node
return true

while the node's parent is not invalid

if the parent node is greather than the iterator's node
set the iterator's node to the parent node
otherwise set the iterator's node to the parent node and return true
